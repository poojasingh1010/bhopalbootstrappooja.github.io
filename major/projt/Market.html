<h3><span class="count">01 - Bhopal to Vidisha Road Trip</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="second2">
<img src="images/bhpltovidisha.jpg">
</img>
<p>Sitting in Bhopal, if you wish to start the engine of the bike for a new place, then set your GPS for Vidisha. Just 57 km away from the capital city, this town is famous for its cultural heritage and historical monuments. Under the reign of the mighty Gupta empire, the history of the place is as astonishing as the view of the scenic road on a bike trip from Bhopal.

If you are an art lover or a fond traveller, the place won’t disappoint you. The city lies at the meeting point of the Betwa and the Beas River, so if you visit during September to March, the place will be as pleasant as the calm waters of these rivers.

The best route to follow is the Bhopal-Vidisha Highway, the reason being that the highway takes you through two major cities that you would definitely want to explore, the city of Balampur and Sanchi.


<h5>Route of the Trip: Bhopal-Balampur-Salamatpur-Sanchi-Vidisha.</h5>

<h5>Distance from Bhopal: 57 Km.</h5>

<h3><span class="count">02 - Bhopal to Panchmari Road Trip</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="second2">
<img src="images/bhpltopachmari.jpg">
</img>
<p>Pachmarhi has situated 194 km from the capital city, and this road trip near Bhopal is almost 5 hours long. There are two routes that can be taken from Bhopal to reach here. One, via Hoshangabad Road and MP SH 22, second, via NH45. The latter takes a bit more time but has more cities on its trails.

When you see that the sky is filled with clouds, it’s about to rain and you’re are in Bhopal, just know that you are in the best season to go on a trip to Pachmarhi. For those who count retrieval monsoon as actual monsoons, the best season talked about there is from April to October.

The best part of the trip is the moment when the open landscape changes into thick forests and the adrenaline just pumps into the body. The ‘Queen of Satpura’, the Panchmarhi plateau is a dream come true for nature enthusiasts and wildlife lovers.

If you plan a bike trip from Bhopal to here, don’t forget to carry food, water and camping gear with you.</p>

<p>The city of wisdom, Sanchi is just 48 km away from Bhopal. If road trips from Bhopal don’t send you on a journey to seek wisdom, then reroute yourself on the Bhopal-Vidisha highway to visit the city of Sanchi.

From the historic and famous Sanchi Stupa to the Buddhist incantations on various monuments in the city, words of wisdom and peace are left for you to decipher. Skip the summers and rest of the year is good enough to visit the place.

The place, constructed on the orders of King Ashoka, stands strong to this date and is an epitome of the Buddhist philosophy. The site is also marked by UNESCO as a ‘World Heritage Site’. If you fancy some nature on the way, then the Halali Dam is just around the highway and is open to tourists.

<h3><span class="count">04 - Bhopal to Amarkantak Road Trip</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="second2">
<img src="images/amarkantak.jpg">
</img>
<p>10 hour 40 minutes, 555 km from Bhopal, Amarkantak is the ‘Teerthraj’ of Hindu pilgrimage. The region has a rich natural heritage and can be best enjoyed during the months of March and September. Tune into the ‘Maa-Rewa’ track by Indian ocean and watch the origination of the holy Narmada river from the Amarkantak hills.

The place is also the birth ground of the River Son and Johila and is the root of many folktales and poems about these rivers. Your road trip to this natural heaven will be amplified with rich forests and turbulent rivers, which you can find on any of the three routes available from Bhopal.

Although, there is an additional benefit of Satpura National Park if you opt for MP SH 44 and MP SH 22 Roads. The MP SH 22 road from Bhopal will take you through the city of Jabalpur which you cannot find if you are on the third route, the NH 45 Road.

<h3><span class="count">05 - Bhopal to Mandu Road Trip</span></h3>

<div class="second2">
<img src="images/mandu.jpg">
</img>
<p>The grandeur of forts, the serenity of the lake, Roopmati Pavilion, the rock-cut caves, the walls adorned with the paintings, all waiting for you to explore in the city of Mandu. Located 287 km from Bhopal, the place was founded in 11th century by Parmar rulers and was used as a fort capital.

A destination for the romantics, if you want to plan a bike trip from Bhopal, the tales of king Baz Bahadur and Rani Roopmati await you in the ruins of the palace. Since most historic cities are situated near the capital, Road trips near Bhopal are the best way to explore the cities of Madhya Pradesh.

If you are planning a trip, the best season to go is from October to April, when the sun is not too hot and the winds are refreshing. If you don’t mind a little detour on trips, then while travelling on the Indore-Bhopal Road, a slight right for NH 47 will add 1 hour to your 5-hour drive and will also provide a drastic change in the landscape.

<img src="images/bhpltohoshangabad.jpg">
</img>
<p>In the heart of India, along the banks of the holy Narmada River lies a beautiful stretch of nature called Hoshangabad. The place is renowned for its history and the natural marvels it holds within its bounds.

Earlier named as Narmadapuram after the river Narmada, it was renamed after the ruler of the place, Hoshang Shah. Connected with Bhopal via the 77.4 km long Hoshangabad Road, the place can be reached in an hour and 55 minutes.

The best time to visit the place is between the months of March to October, when the river is gushing and the road leading to the place is surrounded by seasonal ponds and lakes. The trip will have very few stops in the middle and a whole lot of nature to explore.

Just be mindful of the fact that the River Narmada tends to overflow during the monsoon, so it’s recommended to have a traffic update before heading out during monsoons.

Unless you are a devotee, then a spiritual call is all that takes to motivate you to visit the city of Ujjain. The river Shipra that banks this city along with the historical monuments add on to the beauty of Ujjain.
