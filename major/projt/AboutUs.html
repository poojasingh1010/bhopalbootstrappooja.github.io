<h1>ABOUT

</h1>

<h5>
Bhopal is said to have been founded by the king Bhoja of the Paramara dynasty (1000-1055 CE), who ruled from his capital at Dhar. 
According to this theory, Bhopal was originally known as Bhojpal after the king and the dam ("pal") constructed by him.
 The Bhimbetka rock shelters are one of the famous archaeological World Heritage sites located in the Indian state of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The Bhimbetka shelters exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India and deliver traces of dance from prehistoric times; Some of the Stone Age rock paintings found among the Bhimbetka rock shelters are approximately 30,000 years old.

The city has a population of around 18 lakhs. Bhopal is at the centre of innovative creativity with its art galleries and visual or performing houses of excellence. With broad avenues, exquisitely laid out gardens and parks and buildings that bear an aristocratic stamp, Bhopal strikes the right cord between the new and the old. Students can look forward to sightseeing locations, exciting times at the lounges, interesting places to shop from and finally delicious local delicacies to gorge upon.

Situated at the nucleus of two large lakes, the safe city of Bhopal is an ideal choice for students. 
The airways and the railway are well connected to all major cities of India and the campus is well connected with the city. Auto rickshaws, taxis and buses are also available. Distance between the city and the airport is 20 kms while the railway station is located 12 kms away.

Many national institutes, including AIIMS, NIFT (National Institute of Fashion Technology), and others are soon opening their campuses in the city.
