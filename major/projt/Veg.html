<p>This restaurant of Hotel Lake View has been appreciated for its mesmerizing atmosphere and scenic privileges it provides to its customer. It offers vegetarian food but it is not up to the level of excellence, it is mediocre and also at a high cost. ThUS attracts the youth often and is a chill out spot, but at a price heavy on the pockets of the customer. The service is nice and friendly. Overall, you would have a good experience but if you are a gourmet, you would have some trouble with the food.

Address: Hotel Ashoka, Lake View Road, Shymala Hills, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh 462002.
