<p>This extremely well-done museum is dedicated to the tribal people who make up over 10 million of the population of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
 Opened in 2013, this is not a storehouse of dead objects. 
 Created with the labours of a thousand tribal artistes arriving in batches,
 from every part of the state, recasting myth and life in amazing visuals,
 out of traditional materials like wood, iron, jute, mud, clay, straw, hemp and leaves, as well as canvas, acrylic and glass. 
 Seven major tribes of Madhya Pradesh (MP) Gond, Bhil, Baiga, Kol, Korku, Sahariya,
 Bhariya — have recorded their fast disappearing traditions in the tribal museum in Bhopal,
 transforming the oral narratives into huge paintings and sculptures.
